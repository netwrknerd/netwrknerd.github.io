Welcome to my website! This page acts as a living, digital resume that I can easily update for the world to see. Iâ€™m constantly learning new technologies and experiencing new responsibilities in my role at Expedient. This makes it easier to keep everyone updated along the way.

As an Engineer on the Network Planning & Architecture team, I spend most of my days developing MoPs (methods of procedures) outlining step-by-step how to efficiently keep our core networking infrastructure up to date. I then execute these strategies at night during change control windows, outside of business hours.  This core infrastructure consists primarily of Juniper MX core routers, Arista DCS colocation switches, and Juniper QFX spines. On occasion I also travel to execute physical cable migrations and chassis installations at various data centers. These facilities operate 24/7 to support various companies across the globe.

I am experienced in a wide range of developing technologies, specifically routing and bridging, and have earned Cisco's CCNA Enterprise certification. I am actively pursuing Juniper's JNCIS-SP certification.
