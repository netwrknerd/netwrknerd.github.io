Hi! I'm Chris, and this is my blog. I am experienced in a wide range of networking technologies, specifically routing and bridging, and have earned Cisco's CCNA Enterprise certification. I am actively pursuing Juniper's JNCIS-SP certification.

I've started this blog because I have an immense interest in computer networking and love to share it with anyone who will listen. I plan to use this medium to express my interests, while also sharing my experiences as a Network Engineer for [Expedient](https://www.expedient.com).

As an Engineer on the Network Planning & Architecture team, I primarily develop MoPs (methods of procedure) outlining how to efficiently keep our core networking infrastructure up to date. I execute these MoPs during change control windows, outside of business hours. This requires me to be flexible with my schedule and adapt to the projects that are currently a priority. On occasion I also travel to perform physical cable migrations and chassis installations at various data center facilities. These facilities operate 24/7 to support various companies across the globe.

Some examples of the devices I work on or have worked on:

## Juniper Networks
* Juniper MX960
* Juniper MX480
* Juniper QFX5100
* Juniper EX4300
* Juniper SRX550M
## Arista Networks
* Arista 7280TR
* Arista 7050TX3
## Cisco Systems
* Nexus N9K
* Catalyst 6509
